# About This Book {.unnumbered}

## About the Author

Dr. Jimmy Moses is a Papua New Guinean entomologist and lecturer at the Papua New Guinea University of Technology's School of Forestry, specializing in ant ecology, biostatistics, and geospatial analysis. He holds a Ph.D. in Entomology from the University of South Bohemia (2021) and has extensive experience in tropical ecology research, particularly focusing on ant communities along elevational gradients.

He currently supervises four master's students and co-supervises a Ph.D. student, Dr. Moses brings significant expertise in both research and education. He has published several peer-reviewed papers, including work in prestigious journals like *Global Ecology and Biogeography* and *Proceedings of the Royal Society B*.

His technical skills span multiple areas:

- Advanced proficiency in R and Python for statistical computing and data science
- Expertise in GIS and Satellite Remote Sensing
- Strong background in biostatistics and experimental design
- Emerging skills in full-stack app development

Dr. Moses has maintained strong international collaborations, having worked with institutions in the Czech Republic, Germany, and Belgium. He has been actively involved with the New Guinea Binatang Research Center, contributing to both research and education initiatives in Papua New Guinea.

His research interests combine ecological field studies with modern analytical approaches, particularly in ant ecology, spatial ecology, macroecology, and crop protection. He spends his free time reading technical, history, psychology and ecological books and tinkering with code.

## Purpose and Scope

This book is designed to serve as both a learning resource and a reference guide for data analysis in the natural sciences, with applications spanning forestry, agriculture, ecology, environmental science, marine biology, and related disciplines. Whether you're a student, researcher, technician, professional, or hobbyist in these fields, this book will help you develop the skills needed to analyze and visualize data effectively using R.

The focus is on practical applications rather than theoretical statistics, with an emphasis on techniques commonly used across natural science disciplines. By working through this book, you will:

- Master the fundamentals of data analysis in R
- Learn to import, clean, and organize various types of scientific data
- Develop skills in exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Apply appropriate statistical tests for different research questions
- Create publication-quality visualizations
- Implement reproducible research workflows
- Interpret and communicate results effectively

## Features of This Book

This book includes:

- Step-by-step instructions for R with complete code examples
- Practical examples using real datasets from various natural science disciplines
- Exercises to reinforce learning and build skills
- Tips and best practices from experienced researchers
- Reproducible code that can be adapted for your own research

## How to Use the Code Examples

All code examples in this book are written in R and can be executed in RStudio. To use the examples:

1. Make sure you have R and RStudio installed (see Chapter 1 for installation instructions)
2. Install the required packages mentioned at the beginning of each chapter
3. Copy and paste the code into your R console or script editor
4. Modify the code as needed for your own data

The datasets used in the examples are available in the `docs/data` directory of the book's repository and are properly cited throughout the text.

## Software Requirements

This book uses:

- R (version 4.0.0 or higher)
- RStudio (latest version recommended)
- Various R packages (installation instructions provided in each chapter)

## Feedback and Contributions

Your feedback is valuable for improving future editions of this book. If you find errors, have suggestions, or want to contribute examples, please submit them through the book's repository or contact the author directly.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to colleagues, students, and the broader R community whose insights and feedback have contributed to the development of this book. Special thanks to the creators and maintainers of the R packages used throughout this book, as well as the data providers whose datasets make the examples both practical and relevant.
