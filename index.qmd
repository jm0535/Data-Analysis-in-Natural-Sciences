# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to **Data Analysis in Natural Sciences: An R-Based Approach**, a comprehensive guide designed for students, professionals, and researchers across the natural sciences. This book provides practical methods for analyzing and visualizing data using R, with applications spanning forestry, agriculture, ecology, marine biology, environmental science, geology, atmospheric science, hydrology, and more.

## About the Author

This book has been developed by **Dr. Jimmy Moses (PhD)** from the School of Forestry, Faculty of Natural Resources, Papua New Guinea University of Technology. With extensive experience in ecological research and data analysis, Dr. Moses has created this resource to support students and researchers in developing essential analytical skills for natural science disciplines.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:

- **Undergraduate and postgraduate students** in natural science disciplines
- **Researchers** seeking to enhance their data analysis capabilities
- **Technicians** working in laboratories and field settings
- **Professionals** in government agencies, NGOs, and private sector
- **Hobbyists** with an interest in analyzing scientific data

The content is relevant to those working in:

- Forestry and agroforestry
- Agriculture and agronomy
- Ecology and conservation
- Environmental science
- Geography and GIS/remote sensing
- Marine biology and fisheries

## How to Use This Book

This book is designed to be both a learning resource and a reference guide. You can read it from start to finish to build your skills progressively, or use specific chapters as needed for particular tasks.

Code examples are provided throughout, and you can run them directly in R or RStudio. Each chapter includes practical examples using real datasets from various natural science disciplines.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this book, you should have:

- Basic computer skills
- R and RStudio installed (instructions provided in Chapter 1)
- A basic understanding of statistics (helpful but not required)

## Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}

I would like to thank all those who contributed to the development of this book, including colleagues, students, and the open-source community that makes tools like R and RStudio possible.

Let's begin our journey into the world of data analysis for natural sciences!
